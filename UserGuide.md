# User Guide.
  ## Registration:
    ● Users of our web application must be logged in to use our service, so filling all the required sections in the signup form is a must.
    ● An age of more than 18 is required in the date of birth section.
    ● All emails must end with "@Xmail.com" and be a unique email (if the email is repeated an indication of that appears).
    ● If the user already has an account, he can directly log in by entering email and password in the login form.
    ● The logout button at the top left of the sidebar returns the user to the home page and closes his account
  ## Compose:
    ● To send a message, the user chooses the compose button that opens the sections of the message to be filled.
    ● The message must contain at least 1 valid Xmail (that ends with @Xmail.com) to be sent to.
    ● The user must choose a priority for the message as an indication to the receiver how important the message is (with 1 being the highest priority).
    ● Other sections of the message are optional.
    ● Two red stars next to the input field not filled or filled incorrectly.
    ● For entering multiple receivers, comma-separated Xmails are entered in the "to" section.
    ● To add one or multiple attachments to the message, please use the small clip button at the left bottom section of the compose box.
    ● The messages that the user sent are found in the sent section in the side bar so that the user can view.
  ## Drafts:
    ● If you made a message and didn't want to send it, you can save it as a draft using the "draft" button in the compose section.
    ● Draft messages are found in the draft section which is accessed by pressing the "draft" from the sidebar.
    ● By pressing on a message in the draft section, the compose box appears with the old data held by that message; now you can modify it again and send it, send it as it is (if required fields were filed), or save it again as a draft with or without editing (if edited and saved as draft, the old data in the message is overwritten so no new draft is created).
  ## Inbox:
    ● Received messages are found in the inbox section in the sidebar.
    ● Newly received messages appear after refreshing the website ONLY.
    ● In the inbox and all other message sections, there is a box that allows the user to sort the messages by priority or by the date of message creation (default).
  ## Trash:
    ● Any message can be deleted by either the delete icon next to it or by selecting it and then pressing on the delete all icon at the top of the page.
    ● All deleted messages are found in the trash section in the sidebar.
    ● Restoring messages from the trash returns them to the folder they were deleted from.
    ● Deleting messages from trash deletes them PERMANENTLY.
    ● Draft messages that are sent to trash are still opened in the compose box but can't be sent (either save as a new draft or restore it to be able to send it).
  ## Contacts:
    ● The user can save some emails with a name in the contacts section to keep them from being lost.
    ● Saved contact names must be unique so no two contacts can have the same name.
    ● Contact emails must be valid (ends with @Xmail.com).
    ● Each contact can have multiple emails (entered separated by commas).
    ● Contacts can be renamed or deleted, and these two options appear by pressing on the 3 dots on the right of the contact.
    ● There is a box that allows the user to sort the contacts alphabetically or by the date of contact creation (default).
  ## Custom Folders (Labels):
    ● The user can move messages to existing labels by the move button at the top of the page.
    ● Sent and inbox folders are the only ones that support moving to labels.
